# USDA-food-analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a hands-on SQL practice based on real-world open data from the **United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)**. Using SQLite and DataGrip, I explored nutritional data from a food composition dataset, created database tables, imported data, wrote SQL queries, and generated insights to simulate a business analytics case.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **MYSQL** – Create databases and data tables, store and manage data, and perform SQL query analysis
- **DataGrip** – Connect to the database, visualize the table structure and data, and assist in debugging and optimization
- (Optional) **Python / Excel / Power BI** – (To be used in next phase for data visualization)
